# DirectX Game Engine (old and deprecated)

I just decided to restore my old game engine from 2008 year. Well, looks like, that it's still usable.
I did not invest much time in refactoring or following the guidelines of clean code. 

Resource Filesystem(meshes and textures), Particle animation engine, Simple Physics Engine( just google it SPE Engine ), rendering optimization tree, day/night timeline.

### Scene builder (sandbox is not included)
Scene builder sandbox was written in C++ Builder, so I'm not sure if i can restore it.

## Demo is included:
![Demo city](https://github.com/RomanBelokurov/DirectXGameEngine_2008/blob/master/Documentation/gamedev_ru_3.jpg)
### Controls in demo game: 
WASD - Drive car.
Mouse Left - shoot machine gun.
Mouse Right + Mouse move - move turret.
