# DirectX Game Engine (old and deprecated)

I just decided to restore my old game engine from 2008 year. Well, looks like, that it's still usable.
I did not invest much time in refactoring or following the guidelines of clean code. 

Here are some interesting features that implemented in this project: Resource Filesystem(Meshes and textures), Particle animation engine, Simple Physics Engine( just google it SPE Engine ), rendering optimization tree, day/night timeline.

## Demo is included:
